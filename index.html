                <li>What happens in the Scrub Club stays in the Scrub Club, especially every and any display photo of the group.</li>
                <li>A Scrub has no principles in logic, reason and/or rationale. A Scrub just does things. </li>

                <li>A Scrub shall only ever be a man. A woman who possesses characteristics of a Scrub is not called a Scrub, but a Scrubette.</li>
                <li>The night on 19 December 2016 shall forever be remembered as the Night of Immeasurable Scrubbatry. It shall always be brought up during Scrub meet ups, greetings or any festivities where two or more Scrubs are gathered.</li>

            <h1><strong>THE SCRUB LORE</strong></h1>
            <p><strong>December 19, 0 HD
                The Night of Immeasureable Scrubbatry</strong><br>
                On the 19th day of the 12th month of the year of Harambe's Death, a game of Resistance was called between a group of young men. Three instances of Scrubbatry would go on to define the night and the Order.<br>
                The first happened when John Paulo De Jesus voted for the success/failure of the quest with Reuben Tan's character card, despite there being ample warning of the location of his own character card. Upon the revealing of the cards, John Paulo De Jesus surreptitiously checked his character card and realized a discrepancy from his original one. Reuben Tan immediately sat up on his haunches and vigorously pointed at himself, saying, 'HE VOTED WITH MY CHARACTER CARD!'<br>
                The second happened when Mark Chia, despite ample warning and the scrubbatric moment by John Paulo De Jesus, voted as well with his character card.                The last happened when Reuben Tan decided to play as a deep spy by hiding his intentions, despite there not being a need to, the clearest instance of scrubbatry in the night. (For brevity' sake, the story has been summarized)<br>
                That night symbolized the first time the group that would come to be known as the Scrub Club, came together as one, which would prove decisive in the cementing of an official club with a honoured code.<p>
            <br>
            <br><p><strong>December 20-23, 0 HD
                The Creation of the Scrub Club</strong>
                
                On the 20th day of the 12th month of the year of Harambe's Death, John Paulo De Jesus gathered the seven scrubs that had partaken of the Night of Immeasurable Scrubbatry and formed the Scrubs, the precursor to the Scrub Club.<br>
                It was then that the Scrub Code was authored, set forth by the Master Scrubs, the Scrubs Major; Joel Chong, Dominic Choo, Hanniel Sinon and John Paulo De Jesus.<br>
                The remaining four called themselves the Lesser Scrubs, the Scrubs Minor; Mark Chia, Reuben Tan and Kevin Ranola.<br>
                On the 23rd day of the 12th month of the year of Harambe's Death, after using a plastic bag to wrap his Secret Santa gift and writing the giftee's name in ballpoint pen, Alden Teo was inducted into the Order for 'outstanding display of typical scrubbiness' and was added to the Lesser Scrubs, becoming Scrub Minor Alden Teo.<br>
                And thus the Scrub Club was formed.<p>
